HubDrop started with the idea that we could all benefit from drupal module code living on GitHub.

Turns out mirroring drupal modules on github was pretty easy.

Mirroring a module on GitHub, back to drupal.org, turns out to be a lot harder.

In order to make the hubdrop repos at http://github.com/drupalprojects the source, we need to know two things:

1. Who are the users allowed to commit to VCS for each Drupal project.
2. What those users' GitHub usernames are.

Once we can do that, we can automatically grant push access to the correct GitHub users, using drupal.org as the canonical maintainers list.

So, if you are involved in Drupal.org development, see (Issue #2161929 Add a profile field for GitHub accoun) [https://drupal.org/node/2161929]
