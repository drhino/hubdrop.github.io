The brave new world of Jekyll and GitHub pages is bringing us back to basics.  

I for one, am loving every minute of it.

I put this site together in about an hour, sitting on the couch with my family.

I've started a handful of "personal blogs" in Drupal over the years, on whatever server I had at the time.  All of them bit the dust eventually, usually because I just didn't care about them by the time I had to migrate them to another server.

Presumably github has gained enough of a foothold to be around for a long time.  Meaning, this page will be around for quite a long time, without me having to do anything.

We all should get back to basics... and statics.
